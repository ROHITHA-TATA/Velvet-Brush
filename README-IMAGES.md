# Image Placement Guide

To properly display your artwork on the website, please follow these steps:

## Step 1: Save Your Artwork

Looking at the images you provided, you need to save them with these specific filenames:

1. **painting1.jpg** - The colorful Ganesha artwork (first image in your set)
2. **painting2.jpg** - The black and white guitar/musical mandala (second image)
3. **painting3.jpg** - The black and white peacock mandala design (third image)
4. **painting4.jpg** - The sunset silhouette with bridge and palm trees (fourth image)
5. **painting5.jpg** - The colorful floral arrangement (fifth image)
6. **painting6.jpg** - The portrait of woman with guitar (sixth image)
7. **hero-bg.jpg** - Choose any of your artwork that would look good as a background for the hero section (header)

## Step 2: Place Files in Images Folder

Place all these files directly in the `images` folder of your website.

## Step 3: File Format Requirements

- Make sure all images are in JPG/JPEG format
- Recommended image sizes:
  - Paintings: At least 800px width for good quality
  - Hero background: At least 1600px width for full-screen displays

## Step 4: View Your Website

After placing all the correctly named images in the images folder, open `index.html` in your web browser to see your complete art gallery website with all your artwork displayed.

## Image Matching Guide

Here's which image from your set corresponds to which file:

| Image Description | Filename |
|-------------------|----------|
| Ganesha with colored patterns | painting1.jpg |
| Black & white guitar/music design | painting2.jpg |
| Black & white peacock design | painting3.jpg |
| Sunset with silhouette on bridge | painting4.jpg |
| Colorful flower arrangement | painting5.jpg |
| Woman playing guitar | painting6.jpg |

## Troubleshooting

If your images don't appear:
1. Make sure the filenames exactly match the ones listed above
2. Confirm that the files are directly in the `images` folder (not in a subfolder)
3. Verify that the images are in JPG/JPEG format
4. Check your browser console for any errors (F12 key in most browsers)
